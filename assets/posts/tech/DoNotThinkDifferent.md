# Things are changed, From Revolutionary to Routine
<br>
There was a time when Apple stood for things people couldn‚Äôt even imagine. A company that not only addressed needs in groundbreaking ways but also taught the entire industry how things could be done differently.
<br><br>

## iPod
<br>
Take the iPod, for example. Sure, portable music players already existed. But the iPod wasn‚Äôt just another gadget, it was a gateway. Apple combined the device with iTunes, creating a seamless ecosystem that made finding, buying, and enjoying music effortless.

It wasn‚Äôt just about carrying 1,000 songs in your pocket. It was about the experience. It made people fall in love with their music collections all over again. It was simple. It just worked.
<br><br>

## iPhone
<br>
Then came the iPhone, a turning point not just for Apple, but for the entire tech world.

Before the iPhone, ‚Äúsmartphones‚Äù were clunky devices with tiny physical keyboards, used mostly by businesspeople for email and messaging. They were functional but frustrating.

Apple reimagined the smartphone as a full-screen, touch-based device with a simple interface. And everything changed.

We stopped buying minutes and started buying data. The App Store transformed the iPhone into a platform for innovation, enabling developers to build experiences we never thought possible. It wasn‚Äôt just a phone, it was a pocket computer, camera, gaming console, and communication tool all in one.

## Evolution
<br>
As the smartphone matured, improvements came rapidly and noticeably. Screens grew from 3.5" to over 6.8." Cameras got sharper. Graphics became console-quality. Our phones evolved into powerful, always-connected entertainment and productivity machines.
<br><br>

## Fall
<br>
So, what happened?

Now we have smartwatches, smart homes, smart everything. But when was the last time we saw a product that truly solved a fundamental problem? Real, disruptive innovation has become increasingly rare and understandably so. It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect a game-changing invention every year or two.

Technologies like VR and AR are interesting, but for most people, they‚Äôre not essential.
<br><br>

## Things could be better
<br>
The real problem isn't the lack of futuristic tech, it's the neglect of basic user needs.

Battery life is a perfect example. Why isn't there an iPhone with an 8000mAh battery? The usual excuse: ‚ÄúIt would be too thick.‚Äù But how thick, really? 9.5mm? 10mm? If that gave users two or even three days of battery life, many would gladly accept the trade-off.

The headphone jack is another case in point. It was removed before a truly superior alternative was ready. Wireless audio is great, but why remove options that still worked well for many?

The new ‚ÄúAction Button‚Äù? Does it solve any problems? My old Lumia 920 had a dedicated camera shutter button that was far more useful.

What about expandable storage? More RAM, more storage, faster charging.

Where are the front-facing stereo speakers that deliver crystal-clear sound and aren‚Äôt easily muffled just by holding the device? I miss HTC One series.

These aren‚Äôt wish list items, they‚Äôre basics that directly impact usability and experience.

The lack of a dedicated ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button still frustrates many users. It‚Äôs not a trivial UI choice, it‚Äôs a daily pain point.

Meanwhile, Android manufacturers are offering more hardware for less money. And what‚Äôs Apple doing instead? Making the Control Center more confusing, cluttered, and less usable, while we still don‚Äôt have proper notification channels. It‚Äôs either on or off, like a joke.
<br><br>

## The Opportunity
<br>
Here‚Äôs the truth, if Apple listens to users really listens it can dominate the market all over again.

Because when Apple does something, it matters. People expect Apple to set the standard.

But if it continues to ignore the basics in pursuit of ‚Äúwow‚Äù moments, those moments will ring hollow. The excitement will fade. People will notice.

So go ahead:

- **Make the world‚Äôs thinnest phone**, because thinner *must* mean better, right?
- **Put the power button on the back of the Mac mini**
- **Keep the charging port awkwardly placed under the Magic Mouse**
- **Remove MagSafe, then bring it back. Add a Touch Bar, then kill it off** , why not?
- **Try to sell the world‚Äôs most expensive set of wheels for a desktop computer.**
- **Redesign macOS, iOS, and iPadOS not to improve anything, but just for the sake of change** , adding layers of transparency.

I still use a MacBook, but only because I have to, for iOS and macOS development. 
And honestly, I pity every cent I pay extra just for RAM and storage. 
My next upgrade? It‚Äôll happen when 1TB of storage and 32GB of RAM are finally standard on the base model, which, at Apple‚Äôs pace, will probably be in about 15 years. üòÑ
