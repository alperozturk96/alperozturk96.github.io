                There's no doubt that building UIs with SwiftUI is fast and enjoyable. However, the developer experience
                isn't always seamless. One of the most notable pain points is navigation. Developers coming from UIKit
                where navigation is highly flexible and under your full control may find SwiftUI’s navigation limiting
                and frustrating at times.

            <h2>NavigationLink</h2>
            <p>
                Back in iOS 13, navigation was primarily handled using

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview">NavigationView</a>
                </span>

                alongside

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink">NavigationLink</a>
                </span>
                .

                This approach encouraged a more declarative, state-driven navigation model instead of programmatic control.
                While it aligned with SwiftUI’s philosophy, it introduced several limitations and quirks that made it
                difficult to implement dynamic or conditional navigation flows.

            <h2>Using NavigationLink Inside a List</h2>
            <p>
                One common issue occurs when using

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink">NavigationLink</a>
                </span>

                inside a

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list">List</a>
                </span>

                to navigate to a destination view (e.g. DetailView).

                SwiftUI eagerly initializes all destination views for each item in the list. Yes, it sounds surprising
                but it’s true. Normally, we would expect the destination view to be initialized only when the user takes an action to navigate to it.
                SwiftUI evaluates all destinations up front, potentially leading to unnecessary computation and side effects.

            <h2>Pushing the Same View Multiple Times & Dynamically Controlling Navigation</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine that after completing an operation such as a network request you want to navigate to a different view.
                The typical SwiftUI approach involves binding a value to a

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink">NavigationLink</a>
                </span>
                .

                This can be done using a

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state">@State</a>
                </span>

                property type or a

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published">@Published</a>
                </span>

                property inside an

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject">ObservableObject</a>
                </span>
                .
            </p>

            <p>
                Some might describe this pattern as “programmatic” navigation, but in practice, it’s only partially true.
                What we’re really doing is updating some state, which in turn triggers SwiftUI to navigate.
                The flow looks something like this:
            </p>

            <p>
                A value is set → a published value changes → SwiftUI detects the change in the view model → navigation is triggered.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’re not directly performing a navigation action instead, we rely on the observing mechanism and bindings to make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach is debated among developers. Some appreciate the declarative nature, while others especially
                those coming from UIKit miss having direct control over navigation. To be clear, this isn't about being
                against declarative approach, but rather about the ability to trigger navigation directly when needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since iOS 16, using <code>NavigationLink(isActive:)</code> is deprecated, and SwiftUI introduced

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack">NavigationStack</a>
                </span>

                with

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationpath">NavigationPath</a>
                </span>

                for a more flexible and scalable solution. We'll explore that shortly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another problem with the old approach is that if the bound state toggles too quickly due to a race
                condition or something like a double-tap, the same destination view can be pushed multiple times. Although
                it may be difficult to reproduce in this simple demo project, this issue has been widely discussed in the
                community and remains a common pain point.
            </p>

            <p>
                To demonstrate the problem, I triggered a double-tap on the navigation button and was able to reproduce
                the duplicate push behavior.

            <p>
                With iOS 16, Apple introduced a much improved navigation API in SwiftUI, addressing many of the

                </span>

                view modifier.
            </p>

            <h3>NavigationDestination</h3>
            <p>
                To support a fully programmatic navigation model, we can define a

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable">Hashable</a>
                </span>

                enum representing
                our navigation destinations.
                This allows us to model navigation paths explicitly and compare destinations, enabling us to prevent
                duplicate views from being pushed onto the stack.
            </p>

            <p>
                For instance, in the case of a payment flow, we might define a destination like <code>.paymentDetail(PaymentDetails)</code>.
                The <code>PaymentDetails</code> struct containing a unique identifier ensures that each navigation
                event is uniquely represented.
            </p>

            <div class="code-container">
                <button class="copy-button" title="Copy">Copy</button>
                <pre><code class="language-swift">
import Foundation

enum NavigationDestination: Hashable {
    case paymentDetail(PaymentDetails)

    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(self.hashValue)
    }

    static func == (lhs: NavigationDestination, rhs: NavigationDestination) -> Bool {
        switch (lhs, rhs) {
        case (.paymentDetail(let lhsValue), .paymentDetail(let rhsValue)):
            return lhsValue.id == rhsValue.id
        }
    }
}

struct PaymentDetails: Hashable, Identifiable {
    var id: UUID
    var name: String
    var amount: Int
}
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Views</h3>
            <p>
                With this setup, we use

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack">NavigationStack</a>
                </span>

                in conjunction with an array of navigation destinations.
                When a user action occurs, we construct the destination and check if it already exists in the path before appending it.
                This guards against issues like duplicate navigation caused by rapid taps or race conditions.

            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Before I share my personal opinion, I want to be clear: I’m not claiming that the current SwiftUI navigation
                system is wrong. With the recent improvements, it’s possible to build clean, robust, and maintainable navigation flows.
                However, I do question whether it could be simpler.
            </p>

            <p>
                Why do we need

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationpath">NavigationPath</a>
                </span>


                and the

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/navigationdestination(for:destination:)">navigationDestination(for:destination:)</a>
                </span>

                view modifier?
                At the end of the day, most of our needs are relatively straightforward: push a new view, pop back,
                return to the root, or pop to a specific view.

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller">UINavigationController</a>
                </span>

                already solved these problems long time ago in UIKit.
            </p>

            <p>
                In SwiftUI, we now need to define a

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable">Hashable</a>
                </span>

                enum for destinations and write multiple

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/navigationdestination(for:destination:)">navigationDestination(for:destination:)</a>
                </span>

                modifiers to declare what each destination should present.
                There are many variations of this pattern in the community some use a single modifier, others
                encapsulate route logic inside enums, and some abstract it further. As mentioned earlier, with
                good structure, it can be made elegant.

                But the question remains: is this really the simplest path?

                <strong>Navigator</strong> is a lightweight wrapper I created around UIKit’s <code>UINavigationController</code>.
                It allows you to use SwiftUI views and provides imperative navigation control, such as:

                <li>Pop to a specific view</li>
                <li>Pop to the root view</li>
                <li>Clear the entire navigation stack</li>
                <li>Set a custom navigation stack</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To use it, simply place your root SwiftUI view inside a <code>NavigationView</code> or <code>NavigationStack</code>,
                then perform navigation via the

                <span class="external-link">
                    <a href="https://github.com/alperozturk96/Navigator">Navigator</a>
                </span>

                using optional string-based identifiers.
                It’s minimal, flexible, and reminiscent of UIKit's straightforward navigation model.

                solution.

                I'm not suggesting this approach as a production ready or superior solution, but rather as an alternative concept.
                At the end of the day, I enjoy writing and sharing code, and this was a fun exercise in rethinking SwiftUI navigation.
