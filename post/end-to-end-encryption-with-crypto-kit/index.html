                As technology becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the importance of data security is inevitable.
                Every day, we share files, store information in the cloud, and sometimes handle highly sensitive data.
                It's unthinkable for any modern product to store or transmit this data without proper encryption.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this post, I will provide a high-level overview of end-to-end encryption using Apple's

                <h2>Use Case</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine User 1 wants to send a message to User 2 over the internet an insecure channel.
                    A third party (User 3) might intercept or tamper with the message in transit.
                    Our goal is to prevent User 3 from reading or modifying this communication.

                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    To implement end-to-end encryption, we need both Diffie-Hellman key agreement keys
                    (for securely deriving a shared secret) and signing keys (to verify message authenticity). While
                    Diffie-Hellman ensures that the message content is encrypted and decrypted only by the intended parties,
                    signing keys confirm that the message was not altered and truly came from the sender.
                </p>

                <h3>User</h3>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <button class="copy-button" title="Copy">Copy</button>
                    <pre><code class="language-swift">
struct User {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let surname: String

    // Diffie-Hellman keys
    let privateKey: Curve25519.KeyAgreement.PrivateKey
    var publicKey: Curve25519.KeyAgreement.PublicKey {
        privateKey.publicKey
    }

    // Signing keys
    let signingPrivateKey: Curve25519.Signing.PrivateKey
    var signingPublicKey: Curve25519.Signing.PublicKey {
        signingPrivateKey.publicKey
    }

    let messageHistory: [Message]
}
</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Message</h3>
                <p>
                    The <code>Message</code> struct includes the message text, its timestamp, and an optional digital signature.
                    The <code>dataToSign()</code> method encodes only the core message fields (excluding the signature)
                    to ensure consistent signing and verification.
                </p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <button class="copy-button" title="Copy">Copy</button>

struct Message: Codable {
    let text: String

                <h3>Encrypt & Sign Message</h3>
                <p>
                    The sender signs the message using their private signing key, ensuring authenticity.
                    Then, using the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, the sender derives a shared symmetric key
                    from their private key and the recipient's public key. This symmetric key is used to encrypt the signed message.
                    The result can be transmitted securely over an untrusted network.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Can’t the Attacker Decrypt?</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine User 3 is a malicious attacker intercepting the communication between User 1 and User 2.
                    Even if User 3 sees the entire key exchange, including the values being transmitted across the network,
                    they still cannot decrypt the actual message. Why? Because of a fundamental mathematical principle.
                </p>

                <h3>Discrete Logarithm Problem</h3>
                <p>To explain this clearly, I will use small numbers for demonstration purposes:</p>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
                    User 1 and User 2 agree on public value: a prime number <code>p</code>. Let’s say <code>p = 7</code>.
                    In a real-world scenario, this prime number and other numbers would be large.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
                    They also agree on a public generator <code>g</code>. Let’s pick <code>g = 3</code>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
                    User 1 picks a private number <code>a = 4</code> and computes <code>A = 3⁴ mod 7</code>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
                    User 2 picks a private number <code>b = 5</code> and computes <code>B = 3⁵ mod 7</code>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>
                    User 1 sends <code>A</code> to User 2, and User 2 sends <code>B</code> to User 1.
                    Now, User 3 sees <code>p = 7</code>, <code>g = 3</code>, <code>result of A</code>, and <code>result of B</code>,
                    but does not know <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>
                    User 1 computes the shared secret: <code>K = B⁴ mod 7</code> (where 4 is User 1's private key).
                </p>

                <p><strong>Step 7:</strong><br>
                    User 2 computes the same shared secret: <code>K = A⁵ mod 7</code> (where 5 is User 2's private key).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now both users share the same secret key <code>K</code> without ever sending it directly.
                    Even though User 3 knows <code>g</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code>,
                    they cannot calculate <code>K</code> without solving for <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>.
                    This is known as the <strong>Discrete Logarithm Problem</strong>, and for large numbers, it is
                    computationally hard to solve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The actual cryptographic implementation uses very large prime numbers and elliptic curve math
                    (like Curve25519), making it practically impossible for any attacker to compute the shared key.
                </p>

                <p>Here’s the Swift implementation of this secure exchange:</p>

                <h3>Salt & Shared Info Creation</h3>
                <p>
                    This function guarantees that both sender and recipient compute the same salt value, which is then
                    used during key derivation with HKDF. If needed, additional protocol-specific metadata can also be
                    added to the <code>sharedInfo</code> parameter to further scope the derived key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When deriving a symmetric key using the shared secret from Diffie-Hellman key exchange, it’s
                    important to include a salt and shared info to ensure that the derived key is unique and secure.
                    In our implementation, we generate a deterministic salt using the raw representations of both users'
                    public keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By sorting and concatenating these keys, we ensure the same salt is derived regardless of which
                    user initiates the exchange. This prevents mismatches in key derivation and adds an additional layer
                    of uniqueness to the key.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    In this post, we implemented end-to-end encryption using Apple's <code>CryptoKit</code>.
                    With Diffie-Hellman key agreement, we ensured that only the intended sender and recipient can derive
                    the encryption key. With digital signatures, we verified the authenticity and integrity of the messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this example was written in Swift, the same principles apply to other programming languages and platforms.
